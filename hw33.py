PIG LATIN RULES:

1. Take the first part of a word that isn't followed by a vowel and place it after the remaining part followed by "ay"
2. If the part preceeding the "ay" is a vowel, replace the "a" with the vowel
3. Punctuation goes at the end


OUTLINE:

First we need to figure out all of the quirks of the pig latin language as well as certain exception cases.
Then we make a rudimentary version of our pig latin function based only on the root principles and test it out.
Any time we run into an exception case, document it and find a solution.
End development once the function handles all tests without error

DEVELOPMENT PLAN:

* Will just split up a phrase into it's words
* Find the first vowel in the word
* Move all parts before and including the vowel after the rest of the word
* Add the "ay" ending to the new word part
