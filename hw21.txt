HW21 -- Reflection with Intent to Improve
2019-03-11

On exam day, not that much went wrong while taking the exam, but some factors that may have affected my performance included me not having gotten enough sleep. I had 2 tests that day as well as a full-period quiz for math and I spent a large part of my time studying for chemistry. I felt that was where I was most unprepared and needed to divert my effort. I didn't spend too long studying for CS, but I felt I, for the most part, understood the concepts that were being brought up in class. I found the test mostly straightforward with the exception of some questions that I admit might have been reliant on the student having experimented on their own and then discovering those concepts: such as the question about which variable name would cause an error.
Some steps I could take next time include getting more sleep the next time as well as spending more time reviewing the concepts that were discussed in class as well as poking around in the languages that we're learning more to understand how they work. I think it'd be particularly useful to just keep a list in the back of one's notebook containing all of the concepts that we've discussed such that one could review that list and see if there's anything that strikes them or that they don't fully understand. I think the most difficult part about studying for a test is knowing exactly what it is that you don't know, i.e. when you forget to review something that you didn't know was taught in the class and you don't know that it exists.
