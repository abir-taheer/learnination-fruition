"""
POP: Removes the item at a given index of a python list
syntax: [1, 3, 2].pop(0) -> [3, 2]
behavior: Affects the original list. Returns the deleted item.

REMOVE: Removes the first instance of a given item in a list
syntax: [1, 3, 2].remove(3) -> [1, 2]
behavior: Affects the original list. Does not return a new list

DEL: Removes an item at a given index or index range.
syntax: del [1, 2, 3][0] -> [2, 3]
behavior: Affects the original list. Does not return the item that was removed

Aby Ideas prefers del for use in rmNegatives() because we do not need the removed item in this given scenario so it doesn't make sense to use pop in favor of delete.
